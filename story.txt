There once was a man who decided to set sail across the Pacific Ocean in hopes of finding a new undiscovered island. Since no one around him thought he could do it, 
no one volunteered to join him on his expedition. After weeks of trying to find people daring enough to set sail with him, he gave up and decided to set sail by 
himself. He packed plenty of food and other supplies he may need on the way and on September 23, 2020, he decided to set sail on a coast in California. 

The man got tired after sailing for around 5 hours straight and decided to take a nap. The ship was going towards the direction of a huge storm, but the man was still fast asleep. The sun as setting and the high tide kicked in. The ship was being dragged further in the direction of the storm and the waves were so heavy, that they were thrusting against the ship's body. This impact formed a tiny crack in the body, this crack got bigger and bigger! There was water gushing in rapidly!(Rohit Poduri)
