There once was a man who decided to set sail across the Pacific Ocean in hopes of finding a new undiscovered island. Since no one around him thought he could do it, 
no one volunteered to join him on his expedition. After weeks of trying to find people daring enough to set sail with him, he gave up and decided to set sail by 
himself. He packed plenty of food and other supplies he may need on the way and on September 23, 2020, he decided to set sail on a coast in California.
